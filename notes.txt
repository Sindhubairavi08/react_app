useMemo
- used for memozation
- used when your performance degrades
- useEffect(() => {},[]) //(function,dependencies)
- entirely based on caching 

useCallback():
- it is very dangerous hook if you don't perform actions properly
- it will directly be intact with your cache memory 
- it wil cache your entire function written inside useCallback()
- performance drastically increases
- many call can come to function but it will just retrive it from the cache it won't render the entire component function
